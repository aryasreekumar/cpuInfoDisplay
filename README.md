# cpuInfoDisplay
Display the contents of /proc/cpuinfo using Qt
This program reads /proc/cpuinfo content and displays it in a window. 

It took a lot of time since my Qt knowledge is very limited.

How to execute:

The output of this program can be viewed by opening the project in QtCreator, building and executing it.
Window directly shows the output and can be scrolled down by pressing down arrow key.
